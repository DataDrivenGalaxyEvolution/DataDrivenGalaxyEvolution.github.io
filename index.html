                    <h2 class="the-team-subtitle">Motivation</h2>
                    <p>Galaxy formation and evolution is a field that combines many complex and interdependent physical processes across different spatial and time scales. Moreover, observational data exists across a large wavelength range, and with heterogeneous spatial resolutions and observing depths, each sensitive to different physical tracers. Astrostatistics and machine learning can help us mine the huge existing and upcoming multiwavelength datasets, effectively down to the pixel and spaxel level, in order to determine the fundamental relationships between galaxy properties and evolutionary processes. Additionally, novel techniques are required to facilitate comparisons between galaxy formation theories and all observational data -- including outlier galaxy populations, and to integrate galaxy formation physics in the inference of cosmological parameters. However, connecting statistics and machine learning results to an improved understanding of key astrophysical processes remains a major challenge. This program will initiate a discussion between the empirical exploration of the extremely large and diverse data sets from both observations and simulations and the deduction of the underlying physics, aiming to answer the question: <i>How do we optimally combine the empirical intuition gained using data science tools with theoretical intuition and knowledge, with the deductive goal of understanding the physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies?</i></p>

                            The Review Talks will provide a broad overview and introduction into aspects of galaxy formation and evolution and statistical and machine learning applications related to the weekly topic. These review talks are all followed by a moderated discussion sessions, where the research and future prospects can be discussed. Three main questions will form a part of each of these review+discussion sessions:
                            <ul>
                            <li><i>How do we properly compare results between theory and observations?</i></li>

                            The lightning & thunder series exist of 1 slide / 1 min talks to introduce ourselves to each other and in particular our goals for the week/weeks/whole program. A 1-slide lightning talk could highlight your expertise, describe what you would like to learn that week/during the program, and your research/collaborative goals. Ideally, if you present a lightning slide, this would be paired with a thunder slide later in the week/program where you describe what you have learned and what progress you made on your goals.
                            We are flexible in the planning of lightning versus thunder slides, and we expect to see mostly lightning slides in the first weeks, and hopefully more thunder slides toward the end of the program.

                            The tutorials will address varying topics in galaxy formation and connected machine learning apporaches, or exist of introductions to statistical and/or machine learning tools, techniques and applications. In the virtual schedule there is 1.5 hour reserved for each tutorial, but speakers are asked to aim their tutorial for about 1 hour of interactive work to allow sufficient time for further questions and discussion.</br>
                            The tutorials will predominantly use the python programming language, and a familiarity with coding and python is strongly recommended.

                            The short networking sessions have the goal to allow participants to meet each other, chat about common interests, and perhaps even start new collaborations together. There are currently three sessions reserved for these networking activities, occuring once every two weeks, and alternating with the ethics discussions.

                            We will host short discussion sessions focused around some of the ethical questions connected with machine learning techniques, applications, and access. A few of these questions are also more widely applicable in galaxy evolution research, astrophysics, and/or science as a whole. There are currently three sessions reserved for these ethics-related discussions, occuring once every two weeks, and alternating with the networking activities. Ethics discussions will not be recorded.

The aim is to highlight additional views and applications, but also additional questions related to the topics of the week. Additionally, we endeavor to predominantly highlight work by more junior participants in this series.

The working groups are lead by volunteers and should be self-organized. During the virtual program most Thursday's are reserved for working groups to have their own meetings and discussions, but both the day and whether to organize meetings is flexible and up to the working group itself to decide.

                    <p>The hybrid Joint KITP-CCA workshop, hosted by the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/" target ="_blank">CCA</a> in New York City, takes place January 30 - February 3 2023. It will have plenary talks and discussion sessions in the morning, and parallel tutorial and workshop sessions as well as free discussion/hack time in the afternoon. The program elements follow a similar setup as those for the virtual program.
